## How it works

The project is divided into two parts:

1. Backend (another repo)
2. Frontend (this repo)

But this repository is referring only to the Frontend part. Frontend need the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Pharmasynthesis/web-client.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd web-client

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the application in development mode
$ yarn start

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000

```
